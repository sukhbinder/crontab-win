# CRONTAB for windows.

Add crontab entries in a textfile and then this programs are executed as per schedule.

To use the crontab.txt, type ``crontab show`` this will open the crontab.txt.

Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
 
Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
indicating with different fields when the task will be run
and what command to run for the task

To define the time you can provide concrete values for
minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').

Notice that tasks will be started based on the  system notion of time and timezones.

Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is shown to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).

For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
at 5 a.m every week with:

```bash
0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
```
